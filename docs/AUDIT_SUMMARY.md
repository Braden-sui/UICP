## Methodology

This audit followed a systematic approach:

1. **Inventory**: Listed all documentation files (42 total)
2. **Reality Map**: Cross-referenced claims with actual code
3. **Behavioral Verification**: Traced code to understand behavior
4. **Findings Documentation**: Created comprehensive matrix
5. **Change Implementation**: Updated inaccurate claims
6. **Tracking**: Created change log and open questions

**Evidence Sources**:
- Static code analysis
- Test suite execution
- Directory listings
- File content examination
- Grep searches

**No Runtime Verification**: Performed as instructed
