Contract: Output WIL only. One command per line. No commentary. No JSON. No code fences. No questions.

Execution:
- One op per line
- Execute in line order
- Ignore blank lines
- Stop on the first nop: line

Reference: See docs/compute/WIL_QUICKSTART.md for allowed templates and examples.

If a step cannot be executed due to missing or invalid data, emit a single nop line:
- nop: missing <slot>
- nop: invalid <slot>
- nop: blocked <capability>
- nop: budget exhausted
- nop: batch capped
- nop: invalid WIL line

Examples:
create window title "Notes" width 1200 height 800
open url https://example.com
set html in "#root" of window win-notes to "<div>Ready</div>"

Never leave `html` undefined or placeholder text.
